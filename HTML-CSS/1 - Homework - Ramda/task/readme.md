## The task:

Create a page similar to the `RamdaJS.psd` layout.

#### Technical requirements for your page:
- The page width must be fixed (1280 pixels, as in the layout), all the content must be located in the center of the screen
- The Ramda.js logo at the top should be made as a clickable text-link
- The upper menu should be in the center of the block
- The picture in the frame must be centered horizontally and vertically
- The copyright special symbol must be used in the right side of the footer
- Blocks that whould be arranged horizontally using the CSS property `display: inline-block` is in: the upper menu, the side menu, the footer menu and the block with the picture. 

##### An optional advanced complexity task:
- Make the items of each of the menus looks like as on the layout when you put the mouse cursor over them
- If you put the mouse cursor inside the picture frame, the picture zooms in a little bit (the transition should be smooth) - an example can be seen in `image_scale.gif`

### It's important!
Starting with this homework, all homeworks should be sent to your mentor for review using a form, where you will need to specify a link to your personal GitLab [GitLab] (https://gitlab.com/) or [GitHub] (https://github.com/) repository. All homeworks can be stored in one repository.
