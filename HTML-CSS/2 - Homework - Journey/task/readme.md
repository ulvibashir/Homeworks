## The task is

Create a page similar to the `Journey.psd` layout. You might also notice the `Journey_Hover.psd` layout, which shows how different items should look, when you hover the mouse cursor over them .

#### Technical requirements for your page:
- The background image should be stretched out to the whole screen irrespective of the screen size, observing all proportions (read about the background-size property)
- The nav-panel  should be half-transparent
- All icons in the header must be made using sprites and placed in one file
- The login form must be centered horizontally and vertically (exclusive of header section height), regardless of screen size 
- Add a green square to the left of the text `Sign Up`, which is placed at the top of the modal window
- Login buttons via Google and Facebook must be created manually, without using pictures
- The first text input field describes how the rest of the fields should look like by clicking the mouse cursor on them, not by hovering the cursor
- The checkbox should switch the display of the check-mark every time you click on it.

#### An optional advanced complexity task:
- Add the transition property for all the hover styles
- Make the checkbox stylized according to the design
