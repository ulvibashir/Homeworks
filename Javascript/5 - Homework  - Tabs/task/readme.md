## The task is:

Implement tab switching using pure Javascript. 

#### Technical requirements:
- Markup for tabs is in the folder `tabs`. It is necessary to display a specific text for the each tab by clicking on it. The rest of the text must be hidden. In the comments you can see which text should be displayed for which tab. 
- Markup can be changed, you can add some classes, id, attributes and tags.
- It is necessary to provide the possibility to change the text on the tabs, and also to add and delete the tabs. It is necessary that the function written in the javascript does not stop working because of these changes.
