1. Describe in your own words what the functions in programming are for.

Used to prevent of code dublicate.
We can call anytime we want. 
We can split works to small parts (ex: setName(), setAge(), getName(), getAge())
One function one action needed for SOLID`s first prinicple (Single responsiblty) not in JS but the same meaning

2. Describe in your own words what is the reason why arguments are defined in a function. Why are they passed when a function is called?

We can use global variables in function but it is not right way.
We can create variables in function (for using only in function scope);
Also we can pass argument when we call the function. This way makes function dynamiclly.
This arguments passed "by value" not "by reference". Function receives copy of the variable.
