## Theoretical question

1. Describe in your own words what the functions in programming are for. 
2. Describe in your own words what is the reason why arguments are defined in a function. Why are they passed when a function is called?

## The task is:

Implement a function that will perform mathematical operations with the numbers entered by the user. 

#### Technical requirements:
- Use the modal browser window to read two numbers entered by the user. 
- Use the modal browser window to read out the mathematical operation to be executed. List of operations that can be entered: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. 
- Create a function to which should be transferred: two numbers and operation, as arguments.
- Display the result of the function execution in the console.

#### An optional advanced complexity task:
- Add a check for correctness of the entered data. If the user has not entered any numbers, or if he has entered a value that is not a number, ask both numbers again. The default value for each of the variables should be the information entered earlier.
