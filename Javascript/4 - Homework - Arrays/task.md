## Teoretical question:

1. Explain in your own words how the forEach loop works.

## The task is:

Implement the function to filter the array by the specified data type.

#### Technical requirements:
- Create a function `filterBy()`, which will accept 2 arguments. The first argument is an array that will contain any data, the second argument is a data type.
- The function must return a new array that will contain all the data that has been passed to the argument, except the data with the type that has been passed by the second argument. That means, if you put the ['hello', 'world', 23, '23', null] array into the first argument and put 'string' into the second argument, the function will return the array [23, null].
